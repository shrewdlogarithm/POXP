# POXP
## Path of Exile Desktop XP Tracker ##

This is VERY much work-in-progress - sharing for feedback/ideas!

### What it Does ###
Watches your Client.txt (log file) and when you zone, checks your Profile via the API and reports which characters have gained (or lost) XP

This basically means it shows you how much XP (% of level) you earned in the last area/map

## How to build/use it ##
This may sound odd, but it's created using a game-creation tool called [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)  
Why?  Because it creates small executables for Windows/Linux/Mac and it's free/easy for anyone to use!  

## Is there a download ##
Right now I'm not sharing an executable because people are wary of those - you can create one for yourself simply by installing Godot, opening this project and 'Exporting' it!
